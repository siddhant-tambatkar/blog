                <p>In my first post, I explored the analogy of the Video Streaming sector and the Earth Observation (EO) sector focusing on the similarities in search costs involved for customers in finding content in streaming providers and finding data in EO data providers. In my second post, I wrote about the significance of evangelizing EO and how it is critical for its long-term growth, more so than for its short-term revenues. In this post, I would like to explore if there can ever be a Google for Earth Observation and how far away are we from this, leveraging on some learnings from my previous experiences in the software industry.</p>

                    <p>In my first job, I was writing code and developing software. In my second job, I was prospecting and selling software solutions. Then, I switched careers into the space industry and in my most recent job, I was a strategy consultant, focused on the Earth observation (EO) market. So, naturally, I have been asking myself this question: How far are we from creating software apps based on EO data? Those that could be used by mainstream consumers and enterprises alike to get answers to different types of questions, depending on their needs. Maybe a queryable interface, where one can go and type a question in and get results powered by EO data among other data? Like a Google for Earth Observation.

                        How far are we from using a Google Earth-like application to search: “how many trees are there in Paris?” and it then shows you the results based on EO data fused with other sources of data — the number of tress, the type of trees and a graph of the change in the number of trees over the years and so on.
                        
                        Or in software terminology, when will we unlock the “Application Layer” of Earth observation? The figure below shows a simplified software operating stack with an example of how Google’s software stack works. <a href="https://aravind-ravichan.medium.com/a-google-for-earth-observation-perspectives-from-an-ex-software-professional-77d3f367612a">Source</a></p>

                <p>Earth went through a significant cooling from 1940 to mid-1970s. The Northern Pacific experienced two major climatic shifts during the last century.</p>

                    <p>One occurred in 1976/77 as discussed by Willis Eschenbach in a post at WUWT on April 09/21, naming it the “Great Pacific Climate Shift”. He did not mention the even greater shift about 35 years earlier, which emerged in the very early 1940th. As any discussion climate change matters should primarily focus on humanly initiated changes, the ist shift around 1940 is of much more interest, as this one may be related to activities at sea, namely the naval war in the Pacific from December 1941 to August 1945. The role of the naval war in the Pacific at the same time is an unexplored issue. Within a very short period of time the belligerent powers amassed a military, aerial, and naval force of an unprecedented scale. Only science of climatology did not take notice although meanwhile there had been seven decades of time available. <a href="https://medium.com/@oceansgovernclimate/global-cooling-a-contribution-from-the-naval-war-in-the-pacific-1941-1945-fa172628517d">Source</a></p>
